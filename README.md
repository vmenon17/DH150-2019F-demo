1. Visibility of system status 
Always keep users informed about what is going on.
Provide appropriate feedback within reasonable time. 

Evaluation


2. Match between system and the real world 
Speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. 
Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. 

Evaluation


3. User control and freedom 
Users often choose system functions by mistake.
Provide a clearly marked "out" to leave an unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. 
Support undo and redo. 

Evaluation


4. Consistency and standards 
Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. 
Follow platform conventions. 

Evaluation


5. Error prevention 
Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. 

Evaluation


6. Recognition rather than recall 
Make objects, actions, and options visible. 
User should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. 
Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. 

Evaluation


7. Flexibility and efficiency of use 
Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user so that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. 
Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 

Evaluation


8. Aesthetic and minimalist design 
Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. 
Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. 

Evaluation



9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors 
Expressed in plain language (no codes)
Precisely indicate the problem
Constructively suggest a solution. 

Evaluation


10. Help and documentation 
Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. 
Help  information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.
