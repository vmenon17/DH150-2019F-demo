The MyFitnessPal app allows users to input and track the nutrition facts on food they intake on a daily basis, and allows users to input the exercise they do to show how much physical activity they get daily. As an overall evaluation, the app performs well in some heuristics, but definitely needs improvement in many others like error prevention, user control/freedom, and flexibility/efficiency of use for example.

**1. Visibility of system status:**
Always keep users informed about what is going on.
Provide appropriate feedback within reasonable time. 

Evaluation:
MyFitnessPal does an excellent job of displaying data in terms of tracking how many calories one has intaken in a day, and how many more they need to take in for that day. The home page clearly displays progress donuts that show your stats and exactly how many more nutrients you need for that day, along with the number of steps you've taken compared to the total amount of steps you need that day. Users are consistently informed about what's going on through these helpful visualizations.

**2. Match between system and the real world:**
Speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. 
Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. 

Evaluation:
As mentioned before, the app tries to employ conventional terminology to its menu options ("Home", "Diary", "Progress"). While the terms are familiar, the "Diary" option might be confusing to users initially, since most people associate diaries with personal items they express their feelings in. In the app however, a diary refers to the record of meals that the user eats daily.

**3. User control and freedom** 
Users often choose system functions by mistake.
Provide a clearly marked "out" to leave an unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. 
Support undo and redo. 

Evaluation:
While MyFitnessPal supports the option to delete food that you have added to your food "diary", the option to delete is not apparent at first glance. The user must swipe the food choice to the left to display the delete option, or they must choose the edit option in the main diary screen, select the food, then tap the delete option.  A better alternative would be to have the delete option display permanently on the side of the food entry (maybe with a small 'x' icon), so users don't have to hunt for the delete option.

**4. Consistency and standards:** 
Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. 
Follow platform conventions. 

Evaluation:
As mentioned before, the app tries to employ conventional terminology to its menu options ("Home", "Diary", "Progress"). While the terms are familiar, the "Diary" option might be confusing to users initially, since most people associate diaries with personal items they express their feelings in. In the app however, a diary refers to the record of meals that the user eats daily.

**5. Error prevention:** 
Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. 

Evaluation:
MyFitnessPal needs to significantly improve their error prevention system on the app. As a test, I chose to input that I ate 99 servings of butternut squash for lunch. The app did not give me any message to indicate that I had inputted something by mistake, although it did mention that I had eaten significantly more than I should have that day. However, the app still should have asked to confirm that I had eaten 7,639 calories worth of squash for lunch, since this amount is unreasonable.

**6. Recognition rather than recall:** 
Make objects, actions, and options visible. 
User should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. 
Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. 

Evaluation:
While the basic features of the app are apparent and visible, many other useful features take a bit of digging to discover and use. For example, the recipies page is extremely useful, but I only discovered the page after a few days of using the app. In addition to this page, there are many more helpful pages in the "more" section of the app, which many people don't access that much.

**7. Flexibility and efficiency of use:** 
Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user so that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. 
Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 

Evaluation:
MyFitnessPal does not offer much in terms of dividing between the experiences of a novice user and an expert user. For a novice user, the app offers an overwhelming amount of screens and options that would confuse someone who doesn't know much about meal/exercise planning. In addition, the lack of a structured approach for new users allows for these new users to be shielded from many useful and innovative features of the app, since they are spending too much time figuring out the basic features of the app. 

Severity Rating: 3

**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design:** 
Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. 
Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. 

Evaluation:
The app does a great job of keeping dialogues short and relevant, especially considering that talking about nutrition facts can become convoluted and confusing to those who don't know much about them. The app sticks to what they believe people find most important when looking at food, and supplements the text with nice data visualizations to further ease the experience of the user.

**9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:** 
Expressed in plain language (no codes)
Precisely indicate the problem
Constructively suggest a solution. 

Evaluation:
The app does a good job of expressing errors and how to fix them. As a test, I chose to input my weight as 9000 pounds. The app gave me an error message that asked me to input a valid weight, allowing me to understand exactly what my problem is and how I can fix my problem.

**10. Help and documentation:** 
Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. 
Help  information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large. 

Evaluation:
The app contains a vast base of articles based on frequently asked questions. Even beyond this, the app offers a customer support chat that you can ask specific questions to. The articles are divided into different categories based on the area of the app the question deals with. Within the articles, the steps to solve problems are clearly laid out, even separated into different sections for users on the desktop version versus the mobile version of MyFitnessPal.
