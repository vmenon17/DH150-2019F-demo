The MyFitnessPal app allows users to input and track the nutrition facts on food they intake on a daily basis, and allows users to input the exercise they do to show how much physical activity they get daily.

**1. Visibility of system status**
Always keep users informed about what is going on.
Provide appropriate feedback within reasonable time. 

Evaluation:
MyFitnessPal does an excellent job of displaying data in terms of tracking how many calories one has intaken in a day, and how many more they need to take in for that day. The home page clearly displays progress donuts that show your stats and exactly how many more nutrients you need for that day, along with the number of steps you've taken compared to the total amount of steps you need that day. Users are consistently informed about what's going on through these helpful visualizations.

Severity Rating: 1

**2. Match between system and the real world** 
Speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. 
Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. 

Evaluation:


**3. User control and freedom** 
Users often choose system functions by mistake.
Provide a clearly marked "out" to leave an unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. 
Support undo and redo. 

Evaluation:
While MyFitnessPal supports the option to delete food that you have added to your food "diary", the option to delete is not apparent at first glance. The user must swipe the food choice to the left to display the delete option, or they must choose the edit option in the main diary screen, select the food, then tap the delete option.  A better alternative would be to have the delete option display permanently on the side of the food entry (maybe with a small 'x' icon), so users don't have to hunt for the delete option. 

Severity Rating: 2

**4. Consistency and standards** 
Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. 
Follow platform conventions. 

Evaluation:
The app tries to employ conventional terminology to its menu options ("Home", "Diary", "Progress"). While the terms are familiar, the "Diary" option might be confusing to users initially, since most people associate diaries with personal items they express their feelings in. In the app however, a diary refers to the record of meals that the user eats daily. 

Severity Rating: 2

**5. Error prevention** 
Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. 

Evaluation:
MyFitnessPal needs to significantly improve their error prevention system on the app. As a test, I chose to input that I ate 99 servings of butternut squash for lunch. The app did not give me any message to indicate that I had inputted something by mistake, although it did mention that I had eaten significantly more than I should have that day. However, the app still should have asked to confirm that I had eaten 7,639 calories worth of squash for lunch, since this amount is unreasonable. 

Severity Rating: 3

**6. Recognition rather than recall** 
Make objects, actions, and options visible. 
User should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. 
Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. 

Evaluation:



**7. Flexibility and efficiency of use** 
Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user so that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. 
Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 

Evaluation:
MyFitnessPal does not offer much in terms of dividing between the experiences of a novice user and an expert user. For a novice user, the app offers an overwhelming amount of screens and options that would confuse someone who doesn't know much about meal/exercise planning. In addition, the lack of a structured approach for new users allows for these new users to be shielded from many useful and innovative features of the app, since they are spending too much time figuring out the basic features of the app. 

Severity Rating: 3

8. Aesthetic and minimalist design 
Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. 
Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. 

Evaluation



9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors 
Expressed in plain language (no codes)
Precisely indicate the problem
Constructively suggest a solution. 

Evaluation


10. Help and documentation 
Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. 
Help  information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.
